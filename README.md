# React Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Created for learning purposes

## Learning Goals (What's inside)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - because that's what I wanted to learn
- [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) - for routing between pages
- [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) - for unidirectional data flow
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) - for automating development workflow & building the project
- [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) - for CSS processing. I used some plugins that made SASS redundant
- [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) - for writing code in ES2015
- [AVA](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) - for running tests
- [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) - for linting
  

## Credits
I've started with [react-starterify](https://github.com/Granze/react-starterify) to save time with the initial setup.

You can use the first release of this project as a starter kit for new projects (I only added Flux and tweaked the build a bit.
